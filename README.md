# Package explaination
In this package, I made a Rough urdf model of an omni directional robot in order to make a simulation with ROS2 Humble.
You can find the necessary URDF files to run the simulation with gazebo, the controls that allows to make the robot move and a launch in order to launch the sim (launch_sim.launch.py)
